description: I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through data science and artificial intelligence. What draws me to machine learning is how it aligns with the way I think. It’s a discipline rooted in structured problem-solving, patience, and constant refinement. A model never says, “there’s no solution” — it makes its best guess, learns from it, and tries again. That mindset — to keep learning, improving, and moving forward — is what makes this field feel like home.
