# AI Engineer


## About Me

I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through data science and artificial intelligence. 

What draws me to machine learning is how it aligns with the way I think. It’s a discipline rooted in structured problem-solving, patience, and constant refinement.

A model never says, “there’s no solution” — it makes its best guess, learns from it, and tries again. That mindset — to keep learning, improving, and moving forward — is what makes this field feel like home.

## Featured Projects

### Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph Construction Using Deep Learning**

[Github Publication](https://github.com/hajarmerbouh/Cybersecurity-Knowledge-graph)

In this project, I applied advanced NLP and deep learning techniques to build a knowledge graph for cybersecurity. I curated a diverse corpus of documents, then used deep learning models to extract named entities like vulnerabilities and attack methods. By identifying and mapping relationships between these entities, I constructed a knowledge graph that provides actionable insights. The final graph was tested to ensure its effectiveness in supporting cybersecurity tasks, such as detecting and mitigating cyber threats.
